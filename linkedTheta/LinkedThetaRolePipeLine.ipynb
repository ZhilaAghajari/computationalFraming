       "[\"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:\\xa0May 1, 2020\\xa0CONTACT:\\xa0Bob Wheaton, 517-241-2112LANSING, Mich. – The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) will continue to provide nutritious food by the truckload to Flint residents throughout May.MDHHS has provided the Flint mobile food pantries since February 2016 in partnership with the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan in Flint.Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, food pantry distributors are taking extra precautions to keep customers and volunteers protected. Each site is requiring volunteers to wear gloves and masks, clean their hands with hand sanitizer often, and take steps to sanitize distribution buildings throughout the day. Customers do not have to step out of their vehicle to receive food – volunteers are asking the customer to simply open their trunk and they will load up the vehicle with food to reduce contact.This month's mobile food pantry distribution will have plenty of delicious, vitamin-rich produce, including onions, watermelon, cabbage and cantaloupe, plus milk.May dates for distributions are:Flint residents can also pick up free nutritional food at the three Flint Help Center locations:Bethel United Methodist Church, 1309 N. Ballenger Highway, open from 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Mondays; Asbury United Methodist Church, 1653 Davison Road, open Tuesdays from 10 a.m.-2 p.m.; and Greater Holy Temple, 6702 N. Dort Highway, open Thursdays from 10 a.m.-2 p.m.The three help center locations now have more proteins to distribute to Flint residents in addition to the produce that's available at all locations. In May they will have ground beef and turkey.Information about additional food distributions will be announced as they are scheduled. To check food distribution schedules, visit the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan website at FBEM.org and find the updated schedule on the Mobile Pantry Distribution page, or call 810-239-4441.# # #\"]"

      "doc 5188 - 0.9992118226600986 - [\"May 26, 2020As Michigan businesses begin to reopen, employers are urged to utilize the State's Work Share program which helps employers experiencing economic pain due to COVID-19 retain their workforce and bring back employees from lay-off as they restart their businesses.\\n\\n“As we begin the safe reengagement of our economy, our job providers can use Work Share to save money and help more people return to work faster,” said Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. “The program can give business owners the resources needed to retain or bring back employees as their customer and business capacity ramps back up. As we continue to phase in sectors of our economy, we must continue to do our part on behalf of the heroes on the front lines of this crisis, including our medical workers, first responders, and other essential workers who are putting their lives on the lines for us every day. We will get through this together.”Work Share allows employers to bring employees back from unemployment with reduced hours while employees collect partial unemployment benefits to make up for the lost wages. Job providers can also utilize the flexible program to retain their skilled workforce and avoid layoffs when revenues decline.Under the program, a worker receives a reduced salary from an employer, but is given a percent of their state benefits plus the additional $600 federal payment in Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) through CARES Act through July 2020. The entire Work Share program is federally funded through the rest of the year.\\n\\nThe governor's recent Executive Order offers employers greater flexibility as they restart their business and bring employees back from unemployment by allowing most employers to qualify for the program. Employers who need to reduce hours and wages by 10 percent to 60 percent can enroll employees in the program.\\n\\n“Work Share offers employers solutions to fit their specific business needs by allowing multiple plans with different reduction levels and the ability to choose how many of their workers will participate,” Dept. of Labor and Economic Opportunity Director Jeff Donofrio said. “The program is great for workers too. For the next two months, the federal government provides an extra $600 to employees on workshare providing wage replacement and incentives to return to work from unemployment. The federally funded program also helps workers by preserving the State's Unemployment Trust Fund to keep their safety net solvent.”\\n\\nWork Share serves as a great incentive for employees to return to work. While employees bring their worker back at a reduced rate, the employees could earn more than if they stay on unemployment.The program offers many options for employers, allowing multiple plans and the option to choose which employees participate in each plan. Employers can create a plan or plans that fit their specific needs with hours reduced by as little as 10 percent and as much as 60 percent. There is only a minimum of two employees per plan, plans can be approved for up to a year and can be ended at any time without penalty. Nearly 700 Michigan employers are already participating in more than 1,700 Work Share plans.“Small businesses across Michigan have found the Work Share program to be a tremendous tool to help them restart their business at a reduced capacity,” said Small Business Association President Brian Calley. “Employers navigating operational issues with the reopening of the economy are urged to explore and understand the flexible options available.”How it Works\\n\\nA worker's weekly wages are $1,000, yet the employer needs to reduce their salary = $108), plus the additional $600 federal PUA payment July 2020. With Work Share, the employee would earn $1,408 can visit Michigan.gov/WorkShare for a tutorial on how to sign up, FAQs and other resources to participate in the program,Business Testimonials on Work ShareDave Dittenber, CEO\\nDRI Restaurants, MidlandThe Work Share program is an excellent way to retain your employees in an economical way. The program has allowed us as business owners the flexibility to bring our employees back to work in a way that fit our needs.\\xa0 As restaurants start the process to reopen and understand what the new normal looks like for our customers and employees, this program can help us scale our staff to meet those needs. Not only will it allow us to reopen as dine-in restaurants when it's safe to do so, it will also give us the opportunity to offer takeout and delivery and provide meals to many of our patrons during these difficult times. We have been able to utilize our most talented employees with reduced hours and compensate them properly for their work.\\xa0 By not having to train new employees we have been able to meet the needs of our customers providing quality food and service, in a different way. The Work Share program has also created excitement for our employees to come back to work and be trained with our new safety measures and guidelines.Jeffrey Douma, Director Human Resources\\nMAG Automotive, Sterling HeightsThis year, COVID-19 forced all of our customers and suppliers to delay all business deliveries and timelines. Mass layoffs of our workforce would imperil our existence.\\xa0 Cutting all of our employee's hours and turning to Work Share became our only option for these times. Working with the Work Share Team and implementing a planned “return-to-work” approach, we were able to maintain all benefits for our employees and reduce work hours of 60% of our employees. We implemented Work Share Groups at all levels. MAG saved payroll costs and allowed us to efficiently manage our future work. Most importantly, this Work Share approach provided assurance to all our employees that MAG would come out of these times unified, prepared, and safely.As challenging as these times have been and with the work overload thrown at the Work Share Team, MAG has received high support from its team members. Work Share has truly been a remarkable gem.Information around the COVID-19 outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus.\"] \n",

      "doc 3242 - 0.9991218441273326 - [\"– Governor Ned Lamont, members of Connecticut's Congressional delegation, and Connecticut Housing Commissioner Seila Mosquera-Bruno today announced the launch of , a new state program to provide rental and utility assistance to qualified Connecticut households financially impacted by COVID-19.As further detailed in the program guidelines, UniteCT may provide up to $10,000 in rental assistance and up to $1,500 in electric utility arrearage payments to landlords and utility companies on behalf of approved tenants. Tenants and landlords will be able to complete and track applications online from any computer or smart phone. Assistance will be available through a call center and at housing counseling agencies and other community partners across the state.UniteCT is funded by Connecticut's $235 million share of the $25 billion Congress appropriated for emergency rental and utility assistance in December's stimulus package. Last week, Congress appropriated an additional $21.55 billion for rental and utility assistance and $10 billion for homeowner assistance, as well as $4.5 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and $500 million to assist low-income households that pay a high proportion of their income for drinking water and wastewater services, as part of the American Rescue Plan.UniteCT builds on the previous work of Governor Lamont and Connecticut's Congressional delegation to promote housing stability during the pandemic, including by:Supporting renters facing eviction before the pandemic ($5 million);Rehousing people exiting homelessness or incarceration ($5.8 million);Providing temporary short-term rental assistance ($26.7 million);Availability of mortgage relief to homeowners ($10 million);Supporting renters excluded from federal assistance because of their or their loved ones' immigration status ($3 million);Providing homeowners additional time to file property taxes;Working with local financial institutions to provide mortgage forbearance; andIssuing and extending one of the nation's strongest and longest-lasting eviction moratoriums. (The Eviction Lab at Princeton University gives Connecticut the third-highest score in the country for that work.)UniteCT brings together stakeholders, including housing counseling agencies, nonprofit partners, municipalities, established community-based networks, and legal services organizations. The Lamont administration is providing $1 million of the federal funding to Connecticut Legal Services to represent qualified households in housing court and is supporting undocumented renters through an additional $4 million in state funds, which are more flexible than the federal dollars. The Connecticut Institute for Refugees & Immigrants (CIRI), along with their community partners, will continue to serve undocumented immigrants, many of whom are anxious about interacting with government directly.“UniteCT provides Connecticut tenants and landlords a much-needed fresh start and further assistance so our families can get back on their feet without worrying about the roof over their heads,” . “The pandemic exacerbated a national housing affordability crisis, especially for families of color who are more likely to rent their homes and more likely to have missed payments through no fault of their own. I applaud Connecticut's Congressional delegation and the Biden-Harris administration for providing the resources required to keep our families safely housed.”“The creation of UniteCT represents a significant increase in financial assistance that will be provided families and individuals that have been impacted by COVID-19,” . “With new programs comes new changes. The Connecticut Department of Housing is eager to continue our work with CIRI, and excited by our new partnership with Connecticut Legal Services. There is more work to be done to continue to combat the effects of the pandemic.”“COVID-19 further exposed the mass housing inequities our country faces – and Connecticut is no exception,” . “As folks try to navigate this pandemic, the last thing anyone should have to worry about is how they are going to keep a roof over their head or keep their lights on. The funding we passed in the COVID-19 relief bills helped launch UniteCT, which will provide resources to tenants in Connecticut to support housing stability and prevent utility shutoffs. We'll continue to work in Washington to make sure Connecticut has all the funding it needs to help those impacted by this pandemic.”“CIRI has long and deep history of assisting refugees, immigrants and survivors of human trafficking throughout the state of Connecticut,” . “We understand the myriad challenges and reservations immigrants have in identifying and accepting government support, and know that trust is essential for those reluctant to seek public assistance.

Governor Brad Little of Idaho released 'Rebound Idaho'…that will consist of four phases and require specific criteria that Idaho and businesses need to meet to begin to reopen,” Vice President Mike Pence said recently.Governor Little approved his Coronavirus Financial Advisory Committee's recommendations for allocation of funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The full breakdown is available at  of the federal funds that have been allocated so far in Idaho – more than $300 million – will go directly to small business in the form of cash grants and cash for personal protective equipment to support workers and customers. No other state is putting up more money to directly support small business.The majority of the remaining amount has been allocated to local governments and tribal governments throughout Idaho.Idaho received $1.25 billion in April as part of the CARES Act. Approximately 36-percent of the funds have been allocated so far, and the rest remains in a state account to cover any extraordinary and unanticipated expenses that may arise.All expenditures of the CARES Act funds will be made available at Transparent.Idaho.Gov, State Controller Brandon Woolf's web site that shows Idaho citizens how taxpayer dollars are being spent.“Our priority is to directly support small businesses as much as possible as we prudently and judiciously expend these taxpayer dollars.

Passengers\\nprocessing through the security checkpoint at Raleigh Durham International\\nAirport (RDU) can expect to see plastic shielding installed at the travel\\ndocument checking podiums and bag search tables.\\n\\n“TSA officers maintain an unwavering commitment to the security mission, and\\nunparalleled service to the traveling public, even during extraordinary times\\nsuch as these,” said Beth Walker, Federal Security Director for RDU and\\nEastern North Carolina.\\n\\nProcedure changes travelers should expect to see:\\n\\nKeep possession of their boarding passes. Instead of handing their boarding\\npass to a TSA officer at the travel document podium, travelers should now\\nplace their boarding pass (paper or electronic) on the boarding pass reader\\nthemselves. After scanning, travelers should hold their boarding pass toward\\nthe TSA officer to allow the officer to visually inspect it. This change\\nreduces the TSA officer's need to touch a passenger's boarding pass thus\\nreducing potential for cross-contamination.\\n\\nSeparate food for X-ray screening. Passengers should place their carry-on food\\nitems into a clear plastic bag and place that bag into a bin. Food items often\\ntrigger an alarm during the screening process; separating the food from the\\ncarry-on bag lessens the likelihood that a TSA officer will need to open the\\ncarry-on bag and remove the food items for a closer inspection. This\\nrequirement allows social distancing, reduces the TSA officer's need to touch\\na person's container of food and reduces potential for cross-contamination.\\nTSA Precheck members do not need to remove items from their bags.\\n\\nPack smart. Passengers should take extra care to ensure that they do not have\\nany prohibited items, such as liquids, gels or aerosols in quantities greater\\nthan 3.4 ounces, in their carry-on bags (water bottles, shampoo). In response\\nto COVID-19, TSA is allowing one liquid hand sanitizer container, up to 12\\nounces per passenger, in carry-on bags. Passengers are required to remove the\\nhand sanitizer from the carry-on bag before being submitted for X-ray\\nscreening. If a bag is found to contain a prohibited item, passengers may be\\ndirected to return to the divestiture table outside of security with their\\ncarry-on bags to remove the item and dispose of the item. The passenger may\\nalso be directed back outside of security to remove, items that should have\\noriginally been divested (such as laptops, liquids, gels, and aerosols, and\\nlarge electronics) and resubmit their property for X-ray screening. By\\nresolving alarms in this manner, TSA officers will need to touch the contents\\ninside a carry-on bag much less frequently, reducing the potential for cross-\\ncontamination.\\n\\nPractice social distancing. Passengers should allow for social distancing to\\nreduce direct contact between employees and travelers whenever possible\\nwithout compromising security. Noticeable adjustments leading up to the\\nsecurity checkpoint include, increasing the distance between individuals as\\nthey enter the security checkpoint, placing visual reminders of appropriate\\nspacing on checkpoint floors and staggering the use of lanes where feasible.\\nNo two airports are alike, so this could look a little different at each\\nairport.\\n\\nWear facial protection. TSA officers at checkpoints are now using facial\\nprotection. Travelers are encouraged to wear face protection to the checkpoint\\nas well. Please note, however, passengers may need to adjust it during the\\nscreening process. Travelers are also encouraged to remove items such as\\nbelts, and items from their pockets, like wallets, keys and phones, and put\\nthem directly into their carry-on bags instead of into the bins to reduce\\ntouch-points during the screening process.\\n\\nTravelers who have not flown since the pandemic are also likely to notice some\\nother changes. They include:\\n\\n  * Reduced security lane usage due to the reduction in passenger volume.\\n  * All TSA officers at checkpoints wearing masks and gloves.\\n  * TSA officers optionally wearing eye protection and clear plastic face shields at some locations.\\n  * TSA officers will continue the practice of changing gloves after each pat-down.\\n  * Plastic shielding installed at many travel document checking podiums, divest, bag search and drop off locations.\\n  * TSA officers practicing social distancing.\\n  * Routine cleaning and disinfecting of frequently touched surfaces in the screening checkpoint area.\\n\\nMany airlines and airports are also providing specific COVID-19 related\\nguidance to travelers; please check with your airline prior to your trip.\\nTravelers are encouraged to arrive at the airport early to allow adequate time\\nfor checking bags, completing security screening and getting to the departure\\ngate. Individuals who were traveling in the early months of the pandemic\\nbecame accustomed to arriving at the security checkpoint shortly before their\\nflight departure time. With more people flying and new procedures such as\\nsocial distancing, do allow ample time for the pre-flight experience.\\n\\nThe TSA reminds passengers that knives, tools greater than 7 inches and guns\\nare not permitted in carry-on bags. Firearms may be transported in your\\nchecked bag if they are declared to the airline at check-in, unloaded and\\nplaced in a locked, hard-sided case.

      "doc 129 - 0.9962616822429907 - [\"OMAHA, Neb. – “Stay Healthy. Stay Secure.” is the Transportation\\nAdministration's new campaign that focuses on airport checkpoint modifications\\nto help contain the spread of COVID-19, comply with CDC guidelines and support\\nhealthy and secure summer travel to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\\n\\nThroughout June, TSA saw an increase in the number of individuals coming\\nthrough airport checkpoints and is monitoring the growth closely for staffing\\nand security purposes.\\n\\n“During this pandemic our TSA officers are remaining focused on their security\\nmission and as travelers come to the checkpoint, they will observe our\\nofficers wearing masks and changing gloves between each pat-down and using a\\nfresh swab when checking for explosive material,” said Michael Fowler, TSA's\\nFederal Security Director for Nebraska. “Passengers should also be wearing\\nface protection and following CDC guidance for hand washing and social\\ndistancing to help do their part to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 during\\ntheir journey.”\\n\\nTSA procedural changes that travelers should expect are outlined below.\\n\\n  * Passengers should be wearing facial protection/masks and practice social distancing in the checkpoint line. Please note, however, passengers may be required to adjust their masks during the screening process to verify ID or if their mask triggers an alarm.\\n  * Passengers should keep possession of their boarding passes. Instead of handing their boarding pass to a TSA officer at the travel document podium, travelers should place their boarding pass (paper or electronic) on the boarding pass reader themselves. After scanning, travelers should hold their boarding pass toward the TSA officer to allow the officer to visually inspect it. This change reduces the TSA officer's need to touch a passenger's boarding pass, thus reducing potential for cross-contamination.\\n  * Travelers should separate food for X-ray screening. Passengers should place their carry-on food items into a bin. Why? Because food items often trigger an alarm during the screening process; separating the food from the carry-on bag lessens the likelihood that a TSA officer will need to open the carry-on bag and remove the food for a closer inspection. It is recommended to pack the food in a clear plastic bag and place the clear bag of food into the bin. This requirement reduces the TSA officer's need to touch a person's carry-on bag and container of food and reduces potential for cross-contamination. TSA PreCheck™ members do not need to remove items from their bags.\\n  * Passengers may bring one liquid hand sanitizer container, up to 12 ounces per passenger, in carry-on bags. Passengers are required to remove the large hand sanitizer from their carry-on bag and place it in a bin for additional screening. Passengers should expect that the screening of a large container of hand sanitizer is likely to take some extra time. Other liquids, gels and aerosols in a carry-on bag continue to be limited to a maximum of 3.4 ounces per item and all of those items must fit into a one clear quart-size bag.\\n  * If a carry-on bag is found to contain a prohibited item, passengers may be directed to return to the divestiture table outside of security with their carry-on bags to remove the item and dispose of the item. The passenger may also be directed back outside of security to remove, items that should have originally been divested (such as laptops, liquids, gels, and aerosols, and large electronics) and resubmit their property for X-ray screening. By resolving alarms in this manner, TSA officers will not need to touch the contents inside a carry-on bag as frequently, reducing the potential for cross-contamination.\\n\\nTravelers will also see additional plastic shields in the checkpoint\\nenvironment to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\nBeyond TSA checkpoint area changes, many airlines and airports are providing\\nspecific COVID-19 and summer travel season related guidance. Travelers should\\ncheck with their airline prior to their trip to determine if the airline has\\nmade any changes to procedures.\\n\\nAs passenger volumes continue to rise, TSA recommends that travelers arrive to\\nthe airport early since new procedures, such as social distancing, may add\\ntime to the pre-flight experience. This practice ensures adequate time for\\nchecking bags, completing security screening and getting to the departure gate\\non time.\\n\\nFor more information about TSA's response to COVID-19 and other adjustments\\nTSA has made at security screening checkpoints, please visit\\n[tsa.gov/coronavirus](/coronavirus).\\n\\n###\\n\\n\"] \n",

The CT scanner applies a\\nsophisticated algorithm during the screening process while an X-ray camera\\nshoots hundreds of images while spinning around the conveyor belt, generating\\na 3-D image of the item being screened.\\n\\nThe image can be manipulated on screen to allow for a better view of the bag's\\ncontents, allowing a TSA officer to clear the contents of a bag for security\\nthreats without having to manually open it for a bag check. Fewer bag checks\\nis beneficial since it reduces physical contact between the traveler and a TSA\\nofficer and speeds up the overall screening process. In addition, travelers\\nmay leave everything inside their carry-on bag when it is screened through a\\nCT scanner.\\n\\n![TDC\\nphoto](?itok=cXNSxrHn)\\n\\nTSA is also using Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) at SEA Airport.\\nThese units are able to confirm the validity of a traveler's photo\\nidentification and confirm flight information in near real time. When\\ntravelers approach the travel document checking podium where a CAT unit is in\\nuse, they should insert or scan their own photo identification. This self-\\nservice opportunity eliminates the need to hand over photo ID and boarding\\npass to the TSA officer, reducing potential cross-contamination. CAT units are\\nalso able to identify fraudulent documents and those that have been tampered\\nwith.\\n\\nEarlier this year, TSA completed installation acrylic barriers in all of the\\nairport's security checkpoints at SEA Airport. The protective barriers are\\nlocated in areas where TSA officers typically interact most closely with\\ntravelers. The presence of these clear shields instill an additional layer of\\nconfidence among travelers and TSA employees during the screening process.\\n\\nOver the past several months, TSA has modified its procedures as part of its\\n“Stay Healthy. Stay Secure.” campaign. Travelers departing SEA Airport and\\nairports across the country can expect to see:\\n\\n> • All security officers wearing face masks and gloves during the screening\\n> process. If a security officer is working in close proximity to travelers,\\n> they are also required to wear eye protection or a face shield. Security\\n> officers will change their gloves after each screening position rotation,\\n> after a pat-down or upon a passenger's request.\\n\\n> • All travelers wearing a mask in the airport and at TSA airport screening\\n> checkpoints. Face coverings need to cover the nose and mouth and fit snugly\\n> against the sides of the face without gaps. A TSA officer will ask travelers\\n> to briefly adjust their mask for ID verification purposes. Travelers without\\n> a mask may be denied entry, boarding, or continued transport. Failure to\\n> comply with the mask requirement can result in civil penalties.\\n>\\n> • Social distancing leading up to and in the security checkpoint\\n> environment.\\n>\\n> • Increased frequency and intensity of cleaning and disinfecting surfaces in\\n> the security checkpoint including bins. This is no substitute for practicing\\n> good hygiene while traveling. Travelers are encouraged to wash their hands\\n> before and after going through the checkpoint.\\n\\nHere are some additional tips for traveling during the spring break period:\\n\\n**Step 1: Pack smart**  \\nTravelers should be aware of the contents of their carry-on bags and make sure\\nthey are not bringing prohibited items to the security checkpoint. To\\ndetermine whether an item is allowed or prohibited in carry-on luggage,\\ndownload the MyTSA app and use the “Can I Bring?” feature. By planning ahead,\\ntravelers can avoid a bag check and reduce the potential for cross-\\ncontamination.\\n\\n**Step 2: Secure items in your carry-on**  \\nWhen removing items from pockets such as phones, keys or loose change,\\ntravelers should secure them in their carry-on bags instead of placing them in\\nbins. Bins are a common use item and travelers should use caution or avoid\\nplacing personal items in them.\\n\\n**Step 3: Traveling with hand sanitizer**  \\nTSA is allowing one liquid hand sanitizer container, up to 12 ounces per\\npassenger, in carry-on bags.

They can be as colorful as you like—featuring pumpkins,\\ncandy corn, superheroes, scary witches or something spookier. Please note,\\nhowever, that TSA officers will ask you to remove all masks\\nmomentarily—costume masks or pandemic masks—to help verify your identity when\\nyou arrive at the travel document checking podium. Since your Halloween mask\\nmay trigger an alarm, it's best to slip that mask on after you finish going\\nthrough checkpoint screening.\\n\\n**Tip 2: Costumes may result in the need for a pat-down**\\n\\nOur TSA officers enjoy the creativity of a good Halloween costume as much as\\nanyone, but please keep in mind that a costume may trigger an alarm at the\\ncheckpoint body scanner, which could result in the need for a pat-down, so our\\nrecommendation is to consider putting on your costume after you pass through a\\nsecurity checkpoint.\\n\\n**Tip 3: Halloween props add to costumes, but about that pitchfork, witch's\\nbroom and chainsaw . . .**\\n\\nIt's important to remember that realistic replica props that enhance a\\nHalloween costume definitely add to the spirit of the holiday, but realistic\\nreplica weapons are not permitted through a checkpoint. Best to pack your\\nreplica scythes, pitch forks, chainsaws, brooms, butcher knives, axes, swords\\nand the like in your checked bags. Don't bring replica explosives such as\\nbombs or grenades in your checked or carry-on bag. They are not permitted in\\neither and we would need to treat them like they are real until they can be\\ndetermined to be just props. So do keep in mind that bringing along these\\nweapon-like props are likely to slow you down at the checkpoint. Plus, you're\\nintroducing the added risk that your checked bag may not make it onto the\\nflight while it is getting a bag search.\\n\\n**Tip 4: It's okay to feed your sweet tooth**\\n\\nTrick or treat? Treats!! There's no limit to how much candy you can bring in\\neither carry-on or checked baggage. However, if you were planning to wash it\\ndown with a pumpkin spiced latte, buy the latte after you finish going through\\nsecurity.\\n\\n**Tip 5: No need to travel in a fog**\\n\\nIf you're unsure whether an item should go in a carry-on bag, checked bag,\\neither or neither, no need to be foggy about the answer. Download the [free\\nmyTSA app](/mobile) to access the “Can I bring?” feature. Type in the item to\\nfind out where you should pack it.

En el lugar, había aproximadamente 150 miembros del personal para recibir una capacitación y prepararse para la apertura de dicho campamento, el cual se ubica cerca del límite entre los condados Teller y El Paso. Una investigación ha identificado un total inicial de 51 personas impactadas por el brote:\\xa0 4 casos confirmados\\xa0 7 casos probables\\xa0 40 personas adicionales que fueron expuestas\\xa0 Todo el personal es mayor de 18 años de edad. El campamento está cooperando plenamente con la investigación del brote, mientras los oficiales de salud pública expiden las órdenes correspondientes de cuarentena y aislamiento al personal que ha sido expuesto o que ya se ha enfermado.\\xa0 \\nAnte las circunstancias, el Campamento con Estadía de Noche Eagle Lake ha decidido no abrir este verano.\\xa0 “Este es un lamentable recordatorio de que estamos muy lejos del fin de la pandemia. El virus se propaga rápidamente entre los grupos de personas; por eso es tan importante que todos se mantengan alertas y que cumplan con las medidas de seguridad para así minimizar la transmisión”, declaró la Dra. Rachel Herlihy, epidemióloga estatal. “Las directrices actuales de Más Seguros en Casa y en Nuestros Entornos Naturales limitan el tamaño de los grupos y las interacciones, con el fin de reducir la probabilidad de que ocurran brotes grandes que pudieran revertir el progreso y sobrecargar la capacidad del sistema local de atención médica”.\\xa0 Los resultados de la investigación de este brote no afectarán la más reciente modificación de la  , la cual permite que los campamentos con estadía de noche operen con estrictas medidas de seguridad.\\xa0 “Evaluamos constantemente las órdenes de salud pública y las directrices, con el objetivo de encontrar un equilibrio entre permitir ciertas actividades y restringir actividades y condiciones que puedan empeorar la pandemia en Colorado. Creemos que aún es seguro que los campamentos operen, siempre y cuando cumplan con las órdenes de salud pública actuales. Si observamos que estas restricciones menos estrictas no pueden prevenir los brotes, volveremos a evaluar la situación”, comentó Herlihy.\\xa0 El 19 de junio, un equipo de epidemiólogos del CDPHE dirigió una consulta virtual para los directores de los campamentos con estadía de noche de todo el estado, en la cual se les ofreció asistencia técnica y asesoramiento acerca de cómo dichos campamentos pueden mitigar y combatir posibles brotes durante el verano.\\xa0 Los padres que tengan preguntas sobre el cierre del Campamento con Estadía de Noche Eagle Lake deben comunicarse con:  .\\xa0 Manténgase actualizado con la última información del COVID-19 en Colorado en:  \\n\\xa0 #### \\xa0 \\xa0 placeholder'] \n",

CDPHE staff conducted a routine, scheduled COVID-19 vaccine compliance visit at Red Rock Pharmacy where they identified compliance issues that indicate Red Rock Pharmacy was not meeting the necessary standards required by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine administration pursuant to the emergency use authorization issued by the FDA.\\xa0 CDPHE identified the following issues while conducting the on-site visit:\\xa0 Red Rock Pharmacy was enrolled in both CDC's Federal Retail Pharmacy Program and CDC's COVID-19 Vaccination Program through the state. They mostly administered booster doses but also primary series doses. In consultation with CDC and due to improper storage and handling of COVID-19 vaccine, CDPHE determined that all patients who received COVID-19 vaccine during off-site clinics held by Red Rock Pharmacy between January 15, 2021 and April 1, 2022, should be revaccinated according to the guidance shown below. Vaccines not stored properly may result in the vaccine being less effective. There are no negative side effects associated with receiving an invalid dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The only risk associated with an invalid dose is that it does not offer protection from COVID-19 the way a valid dose does. The CDC has deemed approximately 2,100 COVID-19 vaccine doses invalid because of these violations and 1,833 patients are impacted. CDPHE is notifying all facilities and patients impacted and will also share this revaccination guidance in those communications.\\xa0 \\xa0 People vaccinated by Red Rock Pharmacy can contact CDPHE with questions at   or 1-877-CO VAX CO (1-877-268-2926).

There are no negative side effects or safety concerns associated with receiving a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine which has not been properly stored. The only risk is that it may not offer protection from COVID-19 the way a valid dose does. Getting vaccinated again will help make sure that you are protected from COVID-19. Affected Coloradans can seek revaccination following the directions below at any vaccine provider in Colorado:  . Colorado Family Clinic received a total of 190 doses of Pfizer vaccine but did not maintain the required temperature data or records of the number of vaccine doses it administered between February 3, 2022 and June 28, 2022. COVID-19 vaccines that have not been stored properly may be less effective and, in the absence of appropriate temperature logs, CDC and CDPHE believe revaccination is appropriate. Up to 190 Colorado Family Clinic patients may be impacted by this event and require revaccination but the exact number is unknown due to the clinic's defunct status and missing patient data. CDPHE has terminated Colorado Family Clinic from participation in the CDC COVID–19 Vaccination Program, though Colorado Family Clinic notified CDPHE of their permanent closure on June 28, 2022. CDPHE has also notified the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA). If Coloradans received a COVID-19 vaccine from Colorado Family Clinic between February 3, 2022 and June 28, 2022 they should reach out to the Vaccine Administration Clinical Support Team at  . They can also call the COVID-19 vaccine call center at 1-877-COVAXCO (1-877-268-2926), available Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. MT, and answers are available in multiple languages. In consultation with Pfizer, and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, CDPHE determined that individuals who received COVID-19 vaccines between February 3, 2022 and June 28, 2022 at Colorado Family Clinic should be revaccinated according to the guidance below. CDPHE encourages affected patients to talk with their health care provider with any concerns or questions about revaccination, but it's not required. \\xa0 People who received doses between February 3, 2022 and April 16, 2022 and then also received doses after April 16 should follow both sets of guidance, timed according to CDC's COVID-19 vaccination guidance. For example, a patient who received two doses of Pfizer between February 3 and April 16, and then received a third dose after April 16, should receive a total of two repeat doses. A patient who received one dose between February 3 and April 16, and then received a second dose after April 16, should also receive a total of two repeat doses. Revaccination is also recommended for 594 patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine at Servicios de la Raza between October 9, 2021 and April 24, 2022. During a routine vaccine inventory review, CDPHE found that some vaccines administered by Servicios de la Raza during this time were administered past their beyond-use date. As soon as CDPHE alerted Servicios De La Raza to issues with vaccine administration, the clinic made appropriate changes to their operations and have demonstrated compliance and correct operations. The clinic is working closely with CDPHE to alert those affected and schedule revaccination appointments.

Asimismo, se recomienda la revacunación de 594 pacientes que se aplicaron la vacuna contra el COVID-19 entre el 9 de octubre de 2021 y el 24 de abril de 2022 en Servicios de la Raza con sede en Denver (3131 W 14th Ave, Denver, CO 80204). Importa señalar que en casos de dosis de la vacuna contra el COVID-19 que no han sido almacenadas adecuadamente, no hay efectos secundarios negativos ni preocupaciones de seguridad asociadas con su recepción. El único riesgo es que esa dosis no ofrezca protección contra el virus de la misma manera que lo haría una dosis válida. Volver a vacunarse le asegurará protección contra la enfermedad. De acuerdo con las instrucciones que figuran más abajo, los coloradenses afectados podrán solicitar su revacunación en las dependencias de cualquier proveedor de vacunas de Colorado : covid19.colorado.gov. a 8 p.m.; y sábados y domingos, de 9 a.m. a 6 p.m. (MT). Se ofrece ayuda en varios idiomas. En consulta con Pfizer, y con arreglo a las recomendaciones de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC), el CDPHE determinó que las personas que se vacunaron contra el COVID-19 entre el 3 de febrero de 2022 y el 28 de junio de 2022 en Colorado Family Clinic deben ser revacunadas de acuerdo a la guía orientativa que se indica a continuación. Aunque no es obligatorio, el CDPHE insta a los pacientes afectados a hablar con su proveedor de atención médica si tienen cualquier inquietud o pregunta sobre la revacunación. \\xa0 Las personas que se aplicaron dosis entre el 3 de febrero de 2022 y el 16 de abril de 2022 y luego también recibieron dosis después del 16 de abril deberán seguir ambas partes de la guía orientativa, basadas en las recomendaciones de los CDC respecto a la vacunación contra el COVID-19. Por ejemplo, un paciente que recibió dos dosis de Pfizer entre el 3 de febrero y el 16 de abril, y luego recibió una tercera dosis después del 16 de abril, debe recibir un total de dos dosis repetidas. Un paciente que recibió una dosis entre el 3 de febrero y el 16 de abril, y luego se aplicó una segunda dosis después del 16 de abril, también debería recibir un total de dos dosis repetidas. Por otro lado, también se recomienda la revacunación de 594 pacientes que recibieron la vacuna contra el COVID-19 en Servicios de la Raza entre el 9 de octubre de 2021 y el 24 de abril de 2022. Durante una revisión de rutina del inventario de vacunas, el CDPHE constató que algunas vacunas administradas durante este período por Servicios de la Raza fueron aplicadas después de su fecha de vencimiento. Tan pronto como el CDPHE alertó a Servicios de la Raza acerca de estos problemas, la clínica realizó los cambios apropiados demostrando que cumple con lo requerido y funciona de manera correcta. La clínica está trabajando estrechamente con el CDPHE para avisar a los pacientes afectados y programar las citas de revacunación. En efecto, se ofrecerán clínicas gratuitas de revacunación en las siguientes fechas:\\xa0 13 de agosto, de 9 a.m. a 3 p.m. - Adams County Back to School Event (9351 Washington St., Thornton, CO) 14 de agosto, de 10 a.m. a 2 p.m. - Servicios de La Raza Pueblo - \\xa0Back to School Event (805 W.

Los pacientes de cualquiera de las dos clínicas que deben volver a vacunarse podrán asistir a estos eventos.\\xa0 En consulta con Moderna y Pfizer, y con arreglo a las recomendaciones de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC), el CDPHE determinó que las personas que se vacunaron contra el COVID-19 más de 14 días después de que venciese el tiempo permitido de almacenamiento refrigerado deberán ser revacunadas de acuerdo a la guía orientativa que se indica a continuación.

CDPHE is currently consulting with CDC on the specific storage and handling incidents to determine the exact revaccination guidance.

Of those, five Illinois counties are at a High Community Level, compared to 33 a week ago; while 49 counties are at Medium Level, compared to 55 last week. IDPH is reporting 15,904 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 in Illinois since December 23, and 47 deaths.\"I applaud Illinois citizens for practicing important preventative measures to reduce the spread of infection and protect our hospital capacity,\" said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. \"It is encouraging to see fewer Illinois counties at an elevated risk for COVID-19, with only five counties currently at high risk.  However, as we continue to experience significant levels of flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections, it is important to continue protecting those most vulnerable to severe outcomes, especially individuals over 65, those immunocompromised, and those with chronic medical conditions.\"Please celebrate the end of 2022 and welcome 2023 by getting up-to-date with the COVID-19 bivalent booster and getting your yearly flu shot, if you haven\\'t already.  Other important steps to protect you and your loved ones include COVID-19 testing, enhanced ventilation at gatherings, and good hand hygiene.  And if you are sick, stay home and reach out to your provider about COVID-19 and flu treatments.  I wish all Illinois residents great health and happiness in the New Year.\"IDPH announced last week that as of the end this year, it is following the lead of the CDC and shifting from daily reporting of new COVID-19 cases and deaths to a weekly reporting cadence. Daily case and death data will no longer be reported as of January 1, 2023. Following that date, IDPH will report weekly data on Wednesday of each week for the previous week ending Sunday. IDPH will continue daily reporting of ICU bed availability and hospital admission data.The CDC announced it was making the shift from daily to weekly reporting of case and death data in October. IDPH officials believe that weekly reporting will provide the public with a more accurate picture of COVID-19 trends across the state over time by tracking cases and deaths by the week they arise, rather than the date they are reported, which may be days or weeks later.Access to tests and treatments can be found at the following test to treat site or by contacting your provider for treatment options, within 5 days of feeling ill.IDPH is helping Illinoisans prepare for the fall and winter surge of COVID-19 cases by offering 1 million free COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to Illinois residents in all zip codes outside the City of Chicago through a partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation\\'s public charity, RF Catalytic Capital and its Project ACT (Access COVID Tests) program.Through Project ACT, IDPH is distributing up to one million at-home antigen tests to 200,000 Illinois households. You can request one package of five tests on a first-come-first-serve basis at the Project ACT website.
