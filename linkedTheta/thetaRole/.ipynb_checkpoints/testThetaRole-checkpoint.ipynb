       "[\"ROCHESTER, N.Y. – With Memorial Day Weekend about to kick off, the\\nTransportation Security Administration (TSA) is ready for the expected\\nincrease in the number of travelers who will be flying out of Frederick\\nDouglass Greater Rochester International Airport.\\n\\n“We are prepared to handle the expected increase in travel volume this summer\\nand at the same time TSA is committed to supporting a healthy and secure\\nenvironment for airline passengers, security personnel and airport employees,”\\nsaid Bart R. Johnson, TSA's Federal Security Director for Upstate New York.\\n“For those who will be traveling this summer, travelers need to know that the\\ncheckpoint experience will look different to those who have not flown since\\nthe start of the pandemic, and individuals flying out of Rochester should be\\nprepared for those changes.”\\n\\nNationwide TSA officers are screening approximately 1.6 million people daily,\\nwhich is a large increase from last year, but still down significantly from\\n2019, when closer to 2.5 million people were screened daily during the busiest\\nsummer days. Due to the increase in the number of travelers since the start of\\nthe pandemic, travelers should arrive at the checkpoint 90 minutes before\\ntheir flight.\\n\\nEveryone in the airport is required to continue to wear a mask as prescribed\\nby [the federal mask mandate](/news/press/releases/2021/01/31/tsa-implement-\\nexecutive-order-regarding-face-masks-airport-security) when they are in\\nairports, bus and rail stations, as well as while on passenger aircraft,\\npublic transportation, passenger railroads, and over-the-road buses operating\\non scheduled fixed-routes. This means that all travelers must be wearing a\\nmask at TSA airport screening checkpoints and throughout the airport and\\nduring their flights. If a traveler does not have a mask, a TSA officer will\\noffer a mask to that individual at the checkpoint\\n\\n“We have what I call a 'new normal' at airport security checkpoints since the\\nstart of the pandemic,” Johnson said. Travelers and security officers will be\\nwearing masks and there will be reminders to socially distance posted at the\\ncheckpoint. When approaching the travel document checking podium, passengers\\nwill see an acrylic barrier that has been installed to reduce opportunities\\nfor cross-contamination. Travelers will be asked to remove their masks for a\\nfew seconds so that the officer can match the individual's face to the photo\\non their ID. Travelers will place their own ID into the credential\\nauthentication technology scanner, thus reducing a touchpoint.\\n\\nJohnson also said that security officers will change their gloves between each\\npat down and travelers may request that a TSA officer put on a new pair of\\ngloves at any time. TSA officers also will be using a fresh swab for each\\npassenger when testing for possible explosive material.\\n\\nSecurity employees will be conducting routine cleaning and disinfecting of\\nfrequently touched surfaces and security screening equipment at the\\ncheckpoints.\\n\\nTSA is now allowing travelers to bring one liquid hand sanitizer container up\\nto 12 ounces per passenger in carry-on bags until further notice. Passengers\\ncan expect that these containers larger than the standard allowance of 3.4\\nounces of liquids permitted through a checkpoint will need to be screened\\nseparately, which will add some time to their checkpoint experience. Travelers\\nalso are permitted to bring individually packaged alcohol or anti-bacterial\\nwipes in carry-on or checked luggage.\\n\\nTo reduce touchpoints, it is recommended that travelers place items from their\\npockets such as wallets, keys, lip balm, tissues and cell phones into their\\ncarry-on bags to be screened instead of putting items from their pockets\\ndirectly into bins. This minimizes the placing of personal items in a bin that\\nyou might hold to your face such as lip balm, tissues and cell phones. It also\\nreduces the chance that travelers will leave something behind in a bin.\\n\\nIndividuals who are planning to travel this summer should consider enrolling\\nin [TSA PreCheck](/precheck)®. The popular expedited screening program allows\\ntravelers to leave on their shoes, jackets, belts and enables them to keep\\ntheir electronics and [3-1-1 bags](/travel/frequently-asked-\\nquestions/what-3-1-1-liquids-rule) in their carry-on bags. [TSA\\nPreCheck](/precheck)® membership is more valuable now than ever before because\\nit reduces touchpoints during the pandemic and puts travelers in security\\nlines that have fewer travelers and move quicker, which encourages social\\ndistancing.\\n\\nTravelers also need to know what can and cannot go in their carry-on bag from\\nfirearms to oversize liquids. It is important to know what items should not be\\npacked in a carry-on bag because if a carry-on bag triggers an alarm, it will\\nrequire a TSA officer to open the bag to resolve the alarm. This means that a\\nTSA officer will have to open your baggage and go inside to identify what item\\nmay have caused the alarm. Remember, it's vital to reduce touchpoints during a\\npandemic, so be sure not to pack any prohibited items. Unsure if an item\\nshould be packed in a carry-on bag, checked bag, either or neither? [Download\\nthe free myTSA app](/mobile), which has a handy [“What can I bring?”\\nfeature](/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/all) that allows you to type\\nin the item to find out if it can fly. Or ask us on Twitter or Facebook\\nMessenger at [@AskTSA](\\n\\n###\\n\\n\"]"

It is supported by Connecticut's Coronavirus Relief Fund, which utilizes federal funding obtained through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES ACT).Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants. It is administered by the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services in conjunction with the Connecticut Department of Labor and runs through December 31, 2021.“Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” . “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare. This is the latest tool in our toolbox to maximize our state's recovery from the pandemic.”“Governor Lamont's relentless focus on health, safety, and economic recovery has made Connecticut a national leader in our response to COVID-19, and the  program represents another timely investment in our people,” . “I want to recognize colleagues at DRS for quickly standing up the  program, and thank the Connecticut Department of Labor for their ongoing partnership. The DRS is proud to contribute to this effort that directs additional support to those helping to sustain Connecticut's comeback.”“This is a job seeker's market. It's a great time for people to get back into the workforce and take advantage of opportunities to improve salary and benefits, or even start a new career,” . “Women were hit particularly hard by the pandemic recession in terms of lost jobs and lost income. At the same time, women remain primary caretakers for their families, making it difficult for them to re-enter the workforce early due to childcare and other responsibilities, which leads to additional lost income. The governor's  incentive is a great added bonus for people who really need that financial help during the back-to-work transition. Thank you to Governor Lamont, Commissioner Boughton, and the DRS team for their partnership on such an important program.”To be eligible for a  incentive payment, a person must:Have filed an unemployment compensation weekly claim with the State of Connecticut for the week May 23-29, 2021;Have filed an unemployment compensation weekly claim with the State of Connecticut for 11 additional weeks between December 27, 2020, and May 22, 2021;Obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and December 31, 2021; andNot file an unemployment compensation weekly claim with the State of Connecticut for any portion of the required eight consecutive weeks of employment.To claim a $1,000 incentive payment, a person is required to complete and submit the  program application electronically – no paper applications are accepted.

Evers said. “The assistance granted today will help ensure Wisconsin can gain access to critical assistance as we continue our work to respond to this pandemic.”Gov. Evers earlier this week requested that the federal government provide the following programs to support the state's response: Public Assistance, Direct Assistance, Hazard Mitigation (statewide), and certain Individual Assistance programs; Crisis Counseling, Community Disaster Loans and the Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Program.The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) notified the state today that it is granting the request for Public Assistance to help provide reimbursement for emergency protective measures taken by state and local governments in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The declaration also authorizes direct Federal Assistance which means when the State and local governments lack the capability to perform or to contract for eligible emergency work and/or debris removal, the State may request that the work be accomplished by a federal agency. The governor's additional requests for assistance remain under review.“The state will work with communities across Wisconsin to ensure federal disaster assistance is received as quickly as possible,” said Dr. Darrell L. Williams, Wisconsin Emergency Management administrator. “We are thankful that our partners at FEMA helped to get a quick response to this request, so we can ensure critical assistance programs are available to communities that are in need.”The major disaster declaration covers assistance to public entities, and will cover eligible projects submitted by counties, cities, townships, tribes, and certain private, not-for-profit organizations. Local governments in the declared counties are now eligible for federal assistance and should contact county emergency management directors for further information. Under the program, FEMA provides 75 percent of eligible costs, while the remaining 25 percent is the responsibility of state and local agencies.\"] \n",

The Pfizer vaccine was authorized last week and is already being administered throughout Washington state.\\xa0“I'm pleased that the Western States Workgroup gave their unanimous recommendation to the Moderna vaccine today and encourages immediate use of the vaccine in our states,” Inslee said. “Having two vaccines to combat COVID-19 will help us begin to recover from this destructive pandemic.”Workgroup members hope that their independent review inspires confidence in Washingtonians around the vaccine's safety and efficacy.\\xa0The first of the Moderna vaccine doses are expected to start arriving from the federal government this week. The storage and handling of this vaccine is logistically easier and should help get the vaccine to all areas of the state.“We still need to be extremely vigilant in taking care of each other until the vaccine is widely available, which will still be several months from now,” Inslee said. “We must continue masking, physical distancing and not gathering with friends and family, especially during this holiday season.

Kemp today announced that Sewon America, a subsidiary of Korean-based Sewon Precision Industry Co., will create 740 new jobs in Rincon and invest more than $300 million in a new Effingham County manufacturing facility. This project is the largest known private investment in the City of Rincon, to-date. This announcement also fulfills the commitment to create jobs and investment in all four of the Savannah Harbor Interstate-16 Joint Development Authority (JDA) counties as a result of Hyundai's Metaplant location in Bryan County - the largest economic development project in state history. Suppliers for the Metaplant have now committed over $1.8 billion in investment, surpassing initial estimates by at least $800 million.“Today we not only celebrate delivering on our promise to create jobs in all four counties in the JDA, but also the growth of a valued partner in our business community,”\\xa0. “On my very first international trip as governor to Korea, I had the opportunity to congratulate Chairman Kim on the company's then-recent expansion and discuss how we could continue to work together. I am proud that those discussions have now led to this announcement as Sewon America continues to grow their Georgia operations.”Speaker of the House Jon Burns, who represents part of Effingham County, also played a role in securing the project and engaging Sewon America executives.“This is a proud day for Effingham County and coastal Georgia as we celebrate the creation of 740 new jobs in our area,”\\xa0. “I want to thank our friends at Sewon America for investing in our community and our state.

This investment of more than $300 million in Effingham County will have a positive impact on the local community and our state.”Sewon America operates one of the largest automobile body parts manufacturing plants in North America. The company opened a manufacturing facility in LaGrange in 2008, which has since doubled in size. Following the completion of the Rincon facility, Sewon is expected to support 1,600 jobs in Georgia.“Sewon America was founded 15 years ago in west Georgia, and I'm very happy to be able to build another Sewon facility in east Georgia. We are very excited about our future as one family in two Georgia locations,”\\xa0. “This growth is possible thanks to the full support and dedication of the Sewon team members, as well as Governor Kemp, the Georgia Department of Economic Development, and Effingham County. Sewon America will continue as an excellent corporate and community partner, and we look forward to continued success in Effingham County.”Sewon's new facility will be located at the Grande View industrial park in Rincon. The new manufacturing location will produce electric vehicle (EV) body parts for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America. Operations are expected to begin in 2025.“It is my pleasure to welcome Sewon America to our community,”\\xa0. “We commend our friends and partners at the Effingham County Industrial Development Authority for working diligently to bring what will be the largest employment and private investment project in the city's history.
